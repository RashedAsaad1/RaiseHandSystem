<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project, "RaiseHandAdmin", is a system designed to manage and streamline the process of raising hands in a classroom or meeting setting. It allows administrators to monitor, track, and respond to hand raises in an organized manner. This can be particularly useful in large classes or meetings where it can be challenging to manage hand raises manually. The system is built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that it can be quickly adopted in any setting.

### Installation

To install and run the RaiseHandAdmin system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/RashedAsaad1/RaiseHandSystem.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory with `cd RaiseHandAdmin`.
3. Join the VENV by joing this directory `cd /RaiseHandSystem/src/RaiseHandUpSystem` and then type `source bin/activate`
4. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Set up your database by running `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
6. Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

Now, you should be able to access the application on your local machine at `http://localhost:8000`.

Please note that this project requires Python 3.6 or later. If you encounter any issues during installation, please check that you are using a compatible Python version.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
To use the RaiseHandAdmin system to manage hand raises in a classroom environment, you can follow these steps:

Installation: Follow the installation instructions to install and run the RaiseHandAdmin system on your computer or server.

Create an account: As an administrator, you need to create an account to manage hand raises.

Create a class or meeting: Once you've logged in, you can create a new class or meeting.

Manage hand raises: When the class or meeting is in session, participants can "raise their hand" digitally in the system. As an administrator, you can see a list of all hand raises, in the order they came in. You can then choose to respond to the hand raises one by one.

Communicate with participants: The RaiseHandAdmin system may also provide you with the ability to communicate directly with participants, either individually or as a group. This can be useful for answering questions or providing feedback.
