## About the Project

The "Raise Hand System" is designed to facilitate interaction in both physical and virtual learning environments. It enables students to digitally signal their need for assistance, thereby improving communication between students and instructors. This system is particularly useful in large classrooms or during online sessions where it can be challenging for instructors to manage participation effectively.

**Key Features:**
- **Hand Raising Functionality:** Students can easily indicate their need to ask questions or request help, whether in a physical classroom or a virtual setting.
- **Participant Management:** Instructors can view and manage hand raises in real-time, helping them prioritize and address student queries in an orderly manner.

**Motivation:**
This system was developed to enhance the educational experience by improving student engagement and interaction, making classroom management more efficient for instructors, particularly during exercises or when direct interaction is needed.
